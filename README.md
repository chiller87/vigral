ViGrAl
======

ViGrAl (Visualization of Graph Algorithms) is tool that address all people who are interested in graphs
and algorithms on these. This tool lets you create a graph easily and choose one of the already implemented
algorithms. Then the software will perform that algorithm on the created graph and visualize it step by
step with a nice coloring and textual explanations.

It should help you understand how the algorithm works and to find out the kind of graph, that this algorithm
will not work correct on.
